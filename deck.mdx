# HTML is Hard

(well, the syntax is easy, but semantics are complicated)

<CodeSurfer>

```html
<!doctype html>

<html>
  <body>
    Hello, world!

import i1d from './assets/1/screenshot-desktop.png'

# LGTM

<img src={i1d} />

# And on mobile?

<img src={i1m} style={{maxHeight: "70vh"}} />

> The HTML `<br>` element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.

<Steps>

> Note: Do not use `<br>` to create margins between paragraphs; wrap them in `<p>` elements and use the CSS `margin` property to control their size.

# That's just one scenario

There are heaps. To name a few‚Ä¶

<Steps>

- `H1` through `H6`
- HTML tables
- `ol` vs. `ul` (or the lack thereof)
- `nav`
- `header`
- `footer`
- `main`
- `section`
- `article`
- `figure`
- `aside`
- `details`
- `mark`
- `summary`
- `time`
- `dd` and friends
- `pre`
- `blockquote`
- `address`
- Dare I mention HTML tag attributes?
- Side note: That ellipsis above is actually one dedicated unicode character; HTML is hard, but so is writing content on a computer.

</Steps>

<Steps>

There are over a hundred HTML tags available for use today.

Most of us use a handful at best.

</Steps>

# Why does it matter?

<Steps>

A lot of the time, it doesn‚Äôt!

But ‚Äúa lot of the time‚Äù isn't a healthy attitude to take (think: accessibility and SEO)

Other times, you might end up making life harder for yourself

</Steps>

<Notes>

- A lot of the time, it doesn‚Äôt! - your browser will probably render the thing just fine. And maybe you can click things perfectly fine.
- But a lot of... - I'm not going to repeat accessibility workshops now, but the argument is the same - do things right, and you can make life easier for people who might have life a lot harder than you
- But a lot of... - Or maybe it's as simple as catering to the fact your mouse and keyboard isn't the one and only input peripheral combination in use across the entire world (touchscreen, keyboard only, etc)
- Other times... - Humans are selfish by nature, so maybe this one will gain your interest: Browsers have been built with specific behaviours taken into account for all of the various tags (like that margin on the P tag that wasn't there on the br tag version)

# Common HTML misuse (with solutions)

# Using `div` and `span`

Solution‚Ä¶

<Steps>

Don‚Äôt.

</Steps>

---

# Usage Notes of `div`

> The `<div>` element should be used only when no other semantic element (such as `<article>` or `<nav>`) is appropriate.

<small><em>Mozilla Developer Network</em></small>

<Notes>

- The div element is considered a last resort. The reality for many of us is it's our first port of call.

</Notes>

---

# Usage Notes of `span`

> [The `span` element] does not inherently represent anything‚Ä¶ It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate.

<small><em>Mozilla Developer Network</em></small>

<Notes>

- The span element is considered a last resort. The reality for many of us is it's our first port of call.

# Okay that's a lot

<Steps>

You're not expected to remember all of them.

But you should at least remember that they exist, and how to find them.

(don't forget search engines are a thing)

</Steps>

<Notes>

Hey remember Google is a thing

- Maybe searching "HTML tag for image with caption" will find what you're after

# Here's my points

<Steps>

- HTML, written well, can make life easier for consumers
- HTML, written well, can make life easier for you
- HTML is big. HTML _is hard_. Be unafraid to always learn new things.

</Steps>

<Notes>

1. HTML is designed to accomodate an audience far bigger than we consider day to day. Write it well, and you can make life easier for so many.
2. Even if you don't care about other people, writing HTML well can make life easier for you because you can get browser defaults that you might not have realised already existed (and instead written a heap of CSS and/or JS, or even more HTML)
3. Our job as software developers is to research and implement solutions. Emphasis on research - every one of us should be unafraid to spend time finding out how to do something right, **because it's our job to**
